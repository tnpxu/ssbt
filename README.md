# ✨ SSBT (Structured Stream Build Tool) ✨

**SSBT (Structured Stream Build Tool)** is a library or framework designed to help data engineers and analysts build, test, deploy, and document real-time data transformation pipelines directly within their Apache Spark Structured Streaming applications. 🚀

## 🎯 Project Goal

Our primary goal is to provide a comprehensive, easy-to-use, and extensible framework that simplifies the development and deployment of complex data integration tasks. We aim to offer a wide array of connectors for common data sources and sinks, robust error handling, and a clear configuration model, enabling developers to build scalable and reliable data pipelines.

## 🌟 Key Features (Planned)

* 🔌 **Versatile Connectivity:** Support for a wide range of sources and sinks including:
    * Local files (CSV, JSON, Parquet, ORC, Avro)
    * Apache Kafka
    * Major cloud blob storages (AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage, Google Cloud Storage)
* 🔄 **Unified Batch & Streaming:** Core abstractions and connector support for both batch processing and Spark Structured Streaming.
* 🔥 **Spark Ecosystem Focus:** Deep integration with Apache Spark for distributed data processing.
* 🛠️ **Configurable & Extensible:** A clear configuration model (using HOCON) and a modular design for easy extension with new connectors or custom logic.
* ☁️ **Cloud-Native:** Designed with cloud environments in mind, including support for various authentication mechanisms and cloud services.
* ✔️ **Data Quality & Operational Insights:** Planned features for data quality checks and metrics collection.
* 🔒 **Transactional Capabilities:** Exploration and potential support for transactional sinks like Delta Lake.

## 🗺️ Roadmap Overview

The project will follow [Semantic Versioning (SemVer)](https://semver.org/). Key development phases include:

* **`v0.1.0` (Alpha) 🛠️:** Establish the core framework, basic Spark (batch & streaming) integration, essential local/Kafka connectors, and initial build/config design.
* **`v0.2.0` (Beta) ☁️:** Expand connector capabilities, introduce initial cloud blob storage support (S3), formalize configuration, and enhance error handling.
* **`v0.3.0` (Beta) ✨:** Add multi-cloud support (Azure, GCP), advanced Spark Structured Streaming features, and operational improvements like data quality checks.
* **`v1.0.0` (Stable) 🏆:** Focus on production readiness, API stability, comprehensive documentation, and performance optimizations.
